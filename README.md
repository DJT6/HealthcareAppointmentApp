## Overview

This project simulates a real-world healthcare scheduling system deployed entirely on AWS.  
It uses a **multi-tier architecture** integrating EC2, DynamoDB, Route 53, and Nginx for secure and scalable access.  
It also features **CI/CD pipelines** through GitHub Actions for automated deployments, and **CloudWatch monitoring** for observability.
